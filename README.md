Description:
This project aimed to evaluate and rank the best places to live in the United States by integrating diverse datasets into a visually interactive Excel dashboard. The analysis focused on key factors such as population, cost of living, education, healthcare access, environmental quality, and transit scores. The findings highlighted Massachusetts as the top state, excelling across several critical dimensions.

Key Highlights:
	•	Data Collection and Integration:
	•	Combined datasets from sources like Kaggle, UnivStats, and Definitive Healthcare to compile comprehensive state-wise information, including population density, rental costs, commute times, healthcare facilities, and weather conditions.
	•	Integrated datasets using Excel functions and macros for seamless analysis.
	•	Dynamic Filtering and Visualization:
	•	Designed an interactive dashboard with state-level filtering through slicers, enabling users to explore and compare data interactively.
	•	Visualized metrics such as rent-to-income ratios, transit scores, average commute times, and air quality indexes.
	•	Data Normalization and Preprocessing:
	•	Normalized datasets to ensure consistent and accurate comparisons across states.
	•	Handled missing data and outliers to enhance reliability and insights.
	•	Key Insights:
	•	Massachusetts ranked as the best state to live in, supported by superior transit scores, education systems, healthcare access, and balanced cost of living.
	•	Factors like air quality (AQI), commute times, and availability of hospitals were crucial in determining rankings.

Impact:
This project serves as a valuable tool for researchers, policymakers, and individuals seeking data-driven insights to evaluate and select the best places to live. It showcases how data analytics can guide decision-making and reveal actionable insights across multiple dimensions.
